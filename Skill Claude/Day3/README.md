## Anti-patterns to avoid

### Avoid Windows-style paths

Always use forward slashes in file paths, even on Windows:

- ✓ **Good:** `scripts/helper.py`, `reference/guide.md`
- ✗ **Avoid:** `scripts\helper.py`, `reference\guide.md`

Unix-style paths work across all platforms, while Windows-style paths cause errors on Unix systems.

### Avoid offering too many options

Don't present multiple approaches unless necessary:

````markdown
**Bad example: Too many choices** (confusing):
"You can use pypdf, or pdfplumber, or PyMuPDF, or pdf2image, or..."

**Good example: Provide a default** (with escape hatch):
"Use pdfplumber for text extraction:

```python
import pdfplumber
```

For scanned PDFs requiring OCR, use pdf2image with pytesseract instead."
````

## Advanced: Skills with executable code

The sections below focus on Skills that include executable scripts. If your Skill uses only markdown instructions, skip to [Checklist for effective Skills](#checklist-for-effective-skills).

### Solve, don't punt

When writing scripts for Skills, handle error conditions rather than punting to Claude.

**Good example: Handle errors explicitly:**

```python nocheck
def process_file(path):
    """Process a file, creating it if it doesn't exist."""
    try:
        with open(path) as f:
            return f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        # Create file with default content instead of failing
        print(f"File {path} not found, creating default")
        with open(path, "w") as f:
            f.write("")
        return ""
    except PermissionError:
        # Provide alternative instead of failing
        print(f"Cannot access {path}, using default")
        return ""
```

**Bad example: Punt to Claude:**

```python nocheck
def process_file(path):
    # Just fail and let Claude figure it out
    return open(path).read()
```

Configuration parameters should also be justified and documented to avoid "voodoo constants" (Ousterhout's law). If you don't know the right value, how will Claude determine it?

**Good example: Self-documenting:**

```python nocheck
# HTTP requests typically complete within 30 seconds
# Longer timeout accounts for slow connections
REQUEST_TIMEOUT = 30

# Three retries balances reliability vs speed
# Most intermittent failures resolve by the second retry
MAX_RETRIES = 3
```

**Bad example: Magic numbers:**

```python nocheck
TIMEOUT = 47  # Why 47?
RETRIES = 5  # Why 5?
```

### Provide utility scripts

Even if Claude could write a script, pre-made scripts offer advantages:

**Benefits of utility scripts:**

- More reliable than generated code
- Save tokens (no need to include code in context)
- Save time (no code generation required)
- Ensure consistency across uses

![Bundling executable scripts alongside instruction files](/docs/images/agent-skills-executable-scripts.png)

The diagram above shows how executable scripts work alongside instruction files. The instruction file (forms.md) references the script, and Claude can execute it without loading its contents into context.

**Important distinction:** Make clear in your instructions whether Claude should:

- **Execute the script** (most common): "Run `analyze_form.py` to extract fields"
- **Read it as reference** (for complex logic): "See `analyze_form.py` for the field extraction algorithm"

For most utility scripts, execution is preferred because it's more reliable and efficient. See the [Runtime environment](#runtime-environment) section below for details on how script execution works.

**Example:**

````markdown
## Utility scripts

**analyze_form.py**: Extract all form fields from PDF

```bash
python scripts/analyze_form.py input.pdf > fields.json
```

Output format:

```json
{
  "field_name": { "type": "text", "x": 100, "y": 200 },
  "signature": { "type": "sig", "x": 150, "y": 500 }
}
```

**validate_boxes.py**: Check for overlapping bounding boxes

```bash
python scripts/validate_boxes.py fields.json
# Returns: "OK" or lists conflicts
```

**fill_form.py**: Apply field values to PDF

```bash
python scripts/fill_form.py input.pdf fields.json output.pdf
```
````

### Use visual analysis

When inputs can be rendered as images, have Claude analyze them:

````markdown
## Form layout analysis

1. Convert PDF to images:

   ```bash
   python scripts/pdf_to_images.py form.pdf
   ```

2. Analyze each page image to identify form fields
3. Claude can see field locations and types visually
````

<Note>
In this example, you'd need to write the `pdf_to_images.py` script.
</Note>

Claude's vision capabilities help understand layouts and structures.

### Create verifiable intermediate outputs

When Claude performs complex, open-ended tasks, it can make mistakes. The "plan-validate-execute" pattern catches errors early by having Claude first create a plan in a structured format, then validate that plan with a script before executing it.

**Example:** Imagine asking Claude to update 50 form fields in a PDF based on a spreadsheet. Without validation, Claude might reference non-existent fields, create conflicting values, miss required fields, or apply updates incorrectly.

**Solution:** Use the workflow pattern shown above (PDF form filling), but add an intermediate `changes.json` file that gets validated before applying changes. The workflow becomes: analyze → **create plan file** → **validate plan** → execute → verify.

**Why this pattern works:**

- **Catches errors early:** Validation finds problems before changes are applied
- **Machine-verifiable:** Scripts provide objective verification
- **Reversible planning:** Claude can iterate on the plan without touching originals
- **Clear debugging:** Error messages point to specific problems

**When to use:** Batch operations, destructive changes, complex validation rules, high-stakes operations.

**Implementation tip:** Make validation scripts verbose with specific error messages like "Field 'signature_date' not found. Available fields: customer_name, order_total, signature_date_signed" to help Claude fix issues.

### Package dependencies

Skills run in the code execution environment with platform-specific limitations:

- **claude.ai:** Can install packages from npm and PyPI and pull from GitHub repositories
- **Claude API:** Has no network access and no runtime package installation

List required packages in your SKILL.md and verify they're available in the [code execution tool documentation](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool).

### Runtime environment

Skills run in a code execution environment with filesystem access, bash commands, and code execution capabilities. For the conceptual explanation of this architecture, see [The Skills architecture](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#the-skills-architecture) in the overview.

**How this affects your authoring:**

**How Claude accesses Skills:**

1. **Metadata pre-loaded:** At startup, the name and description from all Skills' YAML frontmatter are loaded into the system prompt
2. **Files read on-demand:** Claude uses bash Read tools to access SKILL.md and other files from the filesystem when needed
3. **Scripts executed efficiently:** Utility scripts can be executed via bash without loading their full contents into context. Only the script's output consumes tokens
4. **No context penalty for large files:** Reference files, data, or documentation don't consume context tokens until actually read

- **File paths matter:** Claude navigates your skill directory like a filesystem. Use forward slashes (`reference/guide.md`), not backslashes
- **Name files descriptively:** Use names that indicate content: `form_validation_rules.md`, not `doc2.md`
- **Organize for discovery:** Structure directories by domain or feature
  - Good: `reference/finance.md`, `reference/sales.md`
  - Bad: `docs/file1.md`, `docs/file2.md`
- **Bundle comprehensive resources:** Include complete API docs, extensive examples, large datasets; no context penalty until accessed
- **Prefer scripts for deterministic operations:** Write `validate_form.py` rather than asking Claude to generate validation code
- **Make execution intent clear:**
  - "Run `analyze_form.py` to extract fields" (execute)
  - "See `analyze_form.py` for the extraction algorithm" (read as reference)
- **Test file access patterns:** Verify Claude can navigate your directory structure by testing with real requests

**Example:**

```text
bigquery-skill/
├── SKILL.md (overview, points to reference files)
└── reference/
    ├── finance.md (revenue metrics)
    ├── sales.md (pipeline data)
    └── product.md (usage analytics)
```

When the user asks about revenue, Claude reads SKILL.md, sees the reference to `reference/finance.md`, and invokes bash to read just that file. The sales.md and product.md files remain on the filesystem, consuming zero context tokens until needed. This filesystem-based model is what enables progressive disclosure. Claude can navigate and selectively load exactly what each task requires.

For complete details on the technical architecture, see [How Skills work](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#how-skills-work) in the Skills overview.

### MCP tool references

If your Skill uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools, always use fully qualified tool names to avoid "tool not found" errors.

**Format:** `ServerName:tool_name`

**Example:**

```markdown
Use the BigQuery:bigquery_schema tool to retrieve table schemas.
Use the GitHub:create_issue tool to create issues.
```

Where:

- `BigQuery` and `GitHub` are MCP server names
- `bigquery_schema` and `create_issue` are the tool names within those servers

Without the server prefix, Claude may fail to locate the tool, especially when multiple MCP servers are available.

### Avoid assuming tools are installed

Don't assume packages are available:

`````markdown
**Bad example: Assumes installation**:
"Use the pdf library to process the file."

**Good example: Explicit about dependencies**:
"Install required package: `pip install pypdf`

Then use it:

````python
from pypdf import PdfReader
reader = PdfReader("file.pdf")
```"
````
`````

```

## Technical notes

### YAML frontmatter requirements

The SKILL.md frontmatter requires `name` and `description` fields with specific validation rules:

- `name`: Maximum 64 characters, lowercase letters/numbers/hyphens only, no XML tags, no reserved words
- `description`: Maximum 1024 characters, non-empty, no XML tags

See the [Skills overview](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#skill-structure) for complete structure details.

### Token budgets

Keep SKILL.md body under 500 lines for optimal performance. If your content exceeds this, split it into separate files using the progressive disclosure patterns described earlier. For architectural details, see the [Skills overview](/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#how-skills-work).
